# GAME3001A1

In my project, players can do the following:

'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' for target's moment.

'0' for pause (see instruction) '1' for seeking '2' for arrival '3' for avoid '4' for flee

I have some debug tools as well.

'←' and '→' for left and right. 'b' for showing debug drawings.

'Esc' for quit.
